# Ryan-DeShazo-Portfolio

    The portfolio project in my opinion could be one of the most important projects we do this entire semester. This is the first thing potential employers will see when you apply to a job. I wanted to make my portfolio snazzy yet simple. Something that will be easy to build off as I complete more projects. 

    I started with the header. I chose a simple layout that gets the job done. It clearly says who I am, and the viewer can choose where in the page they want to view with my linked tags on the right. I did however want to make the header standout so I made it stick to the top of the page. This will also allow the viewer to easily navigate through the page no matter where they are.

    My about me section tells ... well about me. I also chose to keep this simple. I feel like landing a job isnt all about how much a person knows, but who they are as well. People want to hire someone they enjoy being around. I told a little about my self outside of work so the person can get a better feeling for who I am. I added a quick side profile of myself and wrapped it with a solid black border. 

    I wanted to make my current work section easy to add on to. In the future as I better my skills, I want to make this an interactive portion of the page. The view will be able to scroll left or right and choose between an array of different projects. I figured the best way to set this up would be to use cards and evenly space them between themselves. The viewer will get a picture of what the site looks like as well as a brief discription. I also added a link so the viewer can go the the site and explore for themselves if they choose. 

    I like the thought of giving the viewer the choice to get in touch so I added a form to the bottom. The form is simple and centered on the page. It also has a pseudo class to change the color of the text when they type as well as the submit button. In my opinion this give the page a little spice for the viewer.
